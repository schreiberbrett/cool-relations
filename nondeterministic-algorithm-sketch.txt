Conjure a list of nondeterministic length N, where each element is the symbol 'hole.

If N is odd, replace any 'hole (except the final element, of course) with the ground bit 0.

Create 2 fresh variables: e and o, with the constraint that e =/= o.

while any 'hole in l:
    Nondeterministically do one of the cases:
    Case 1: * Create a new fresh variable x[i].
            * Fill 1 'hole at an even index in L with x[i].
            * Fill another 'hole at an odd index with the same x[i].
    
    
    Case 2: * Fill 3 'holes at even indices with the existing fresh variable e.
            * Fill 3 'holes at odd indices with the existing fresh variable o.
            
At this point, the list contains no 'holes, just fresh variables. You  now have a fully fresh (or nearly fresh) miniKanren number that is divisible by 3.
