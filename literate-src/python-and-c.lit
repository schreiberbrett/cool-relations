@s Introduction

This is an example hello world C program.
We can define codeblocks with `---`

--- hello.c
@{Includes}

int main() {
    @{Print a string}
    return 0;
}
---

Now we can define the `Includes` codeblock:

--- Includes
#include <stdio.h>
---

Finally, our program needs to print "hello world"

--- Print a string
printf("hello world\n");
---

@s And the Python part

--- main.py
def hello():
    print('Hey dude')
